## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or above)
- NPM or Yarn
- Supabase account (for authentication and database setup)
- AWS account (for Lambda and API Gateway setup)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-banking-app.git
    cd web-banking-app
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and configure your environment variables such as Supabase URL and API keys, AWS credentials, etc.

4. **Run the application locally:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. **API Endpoints:**
    - **Onboarding & Registration API:** `/api/onboarding`
    - **Dashboard API:** `/api/dashboard`
    - **Custom Branding API:** `/api/branding`
    - **CRM API:** `/api/crm`
    - **Analytics API:** `/api/analytics`
    - **Script Management API:** `/api/scripts`
    - **Support API:** `/api/support`
    - And more...

6. **Deploy the App:**
    - The app is built with a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
    - Use the **Serverless Framework** for deployment:
      ```bash
      serverless deploy
      ```

## Testing

Unit and integration tests are written using Jest. You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or, for specific tests:

```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
```

## Error Handling

Centralized error logging is implemented using a combination of AWS CloudWatch and custom logging APIs. To view logs:

1. Go to the AWS Console.
2. Navigate to **CloudWatch** and search for logs generated by the Lambda functions.

## Scalability

- The app is built with **multi-user scalability** in mind, optimized to handle high traffic efficiently.
- **Serverless architecture** ensures on-demand scalability to handle large volumes of user activity.
- APIs are designed with **GraphQL** principles for efficient data retrieval and reduced over-fetching.
